\section{Introduction}

The future of global agriculture and its impact on food security is one of the most urgent issues in todayâ€™s world. Farmers must prepare for changes in the climate that is likely to feature more erratic weather patterns that will necessarily have an effect in the emergence and re-emergence of plant diseases. Early and accurate diagnosis systems on local, regional, and global scales are necessary to predict pest and disease outbreaks and allow valuable time to formulate and develop mitigation strategies. Forecasting the appearance and development of a disease is difficult, as many environmental and other factors influence the complex interactions between pathogen, host, and vector.
 
Fortunately, Internet access and mobile phone technologies have much improved during the last few years and are becoming increasingly accessible. This provides a new opportunity to communicate crop pathology information more widely. Containing the spread of plant diseases in a profoundly interconnected world requires active vigilance for signs of an outbreak, rapid recognition of its presence, and diagnosis of its cause, in addition to strategies and resources for an appropriate and efficient response. Due to the rapid spread of plant diseases across the world, disease surveillance and monitoring systems based on multi-country, multi-institution partnerships are necessary to predict pest and disease outbreaks and allowing a valuable time to formulate and develop mitigation strategies. 

Early detection is essential for the control of emerging, re-emerging, and novel infectious diseases, whether naturally occurring or manually introduced as a result of human mobility. Containing the spread of such diseases in a profoundly interconnected world requires active vigilance for signs of an outbreak, rapid recognition of its presence, and diagnosis of its cause, in addition to strategies and resources for an appropriate and efficient response. Considerable time often elapses between the introduction of an agricultural pathogen and its detection. Given sufficient warning prior to the introduction of a new plant disease threat, researchers can reduce the impact of disease by identifying chemical control measures or by breeding resistant crop varieties [11].
